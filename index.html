        Since the beginning of the internet,
        <span class="important">millions and millions</span> and millions of
        blogs have been created. Many have died due to lost interest or their
        owners giving up on the idea, while others have thrived and continue to
        grow, making money and earning their owners a steady income. It’s a
        constant evolution of content that keeps people coming back for more,
        especially if these blogs contact highly resourceful material that
        people find useful and interesting.

        targeting young mums with her money saving, frugal tips and articles.
        And rightly so! The market is massive and she’s meeting a need for this
        type of information. Young mums aren’t exactly rolling in cash. They may
        have had to give up work and are now relying on just one wage coming in,
        so <span class="important"
